# Unity specific ignores appear in '.gitignore' files within the Unity projects themselves
# This is because the default Unity gitignore (https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore) only works when at the root of the Unity project
# Instead of messing with it, we just put it in each Project so it works as expected
